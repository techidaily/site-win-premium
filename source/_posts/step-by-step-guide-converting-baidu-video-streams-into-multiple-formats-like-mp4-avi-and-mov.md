## Step-by-Step Guide: Converting Baidu Video Streams Into Multiple Formats Like MP4, AVI, and MOV

### Overview

* Hi, I have searched two sports videos that I have not found on my usually-viewed sports website, and I want to download them for offline playback on my iPhone. Can you tell me how I can download them, because I have tried half day, but eventually with no luck. Thanks for your kind reply.

Baidu is a Chinese search engine on which users can search to find many their needed files, including photos, files, audios, pictures and also videos. Among all searched videos, there must be some that users want to download them for offline usage. However, not all searched videos through Baidu are supported for download, because Baidu is just a search engine and eventually it will direct users to the video source website for vide enjoyment. Whether the Baidu searched video can be downloaded or not actually depends on the source video website.
