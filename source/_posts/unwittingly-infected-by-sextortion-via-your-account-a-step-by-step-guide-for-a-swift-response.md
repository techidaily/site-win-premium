## What is Sextortion Email Scam?

The sextortion email scam is an attack on your system. This attack involves you receiving an email wherein a hacker claims to have taken over your system using a [Trojan](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) virus. The email continues to claim that the hacker has recorded footage of you watching some sensitive videos and also has access to your email account. Moreover, some attacks might also include sending an email from your own account.

The above claim often appears to be true since the **email is sent to the victim from their own email address** or an email somewhat similar to theirs. Moreover, the email also includes one of the victim’s previous passwords to trick the victim that the hacker actually has access to their account.

Ultimately, the hacker demands the victim to pay them a heavy amount via Bitcoin else the hacker would send the recorded video and private images to the victim’s email contacts. Since the email seems to be legit, most people often fall for it and consider it to be true.

This is similar to email [scams from Mr Beast](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) or [Summon to Court for Pedophilia](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

Remember that this spoofing attack is just meant to scare you and the **hacker does not actually have access to any of your private videos**.

## What to do when you Recieve Such an Email?

The sextortion email scam creates a feeling of urgency among the victims as it threatens them to pay the money otherwise the hacker would compromise their privacy. If you receive any such email or find yourself in a similar situation, you must not panic. The **situation demands a calm mind** to make the right decisions.

Firstly, this email is absolutely a scam, and therefore, you should not worry about it, as the scammer does not have any such video in the first place. The second threat is the actual password of your email account which is mentioned in the email sent by the hacker. You must not worry about it since the **password of your account is just an old password that the hacker might have found through a data breach**. And, there are high chances the hacker does not have access to your current password or account.

Lastly, the question is whether to pay the hacker or not. It is strongly suggested that you do not pay the scammer at any cost. This is because of the following reasons:

* **Paying the hacker will only lead to your financial loss.** Since the hacker does not have access to your private videos or your social media account, you will be paying them for nothing.
* There is no guarantee that the scammer will stop sending you similar emails in the future. Moreover, paying the scammer makes you an easy prey and they might try to threaten you again.
* Paying for such scams will only encourage such hackers to continue scamming people.

### **Change Your Passwords**

If the email clearly mentions one of your actual passwords, it is definitely a threat to your security. Therefore, you must immediately set a new and unique password for yourself. If you haven’t changed your passwords for a long period of time, then it becomes absolutely necessary that you change your password.

In addition to this, you must also ensure that a two-factor authentication system is activated for your accounts. This will add an additional layer of security and prevent anyone from accessing your accounts even if they gain access to your passwords.

Therefore, you must run a thorough scan of your system and remove any unknown or suspected files present on it.
