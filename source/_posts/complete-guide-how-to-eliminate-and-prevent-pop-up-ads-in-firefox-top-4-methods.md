##  Method 1 – Enable Content Blocker

Some websites use trackers that can monitor your activity across the Internet. Content blocking is a collection of Firefox settings that block many of these third-party trackers. It keeps your browsing more private so information about you won’t be invisibly tracked, stored, and shared between websites.

To adjust your settings:

Click the **Menu** button and then click **Content Blocking**.

![Block Pop-ups in Firefox 1-1](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Block-Pop-ups-in-Firefox-1-1.jpg)

This takes you to the Content Blocking section in your Firefox Options Privacy & Security panel.

![Block Pop-ups in Firefox 1-2](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Block-Pop-ups-in-Firefox-1-2.jpg)

Choose your content blocking settings from the below one

1. **Standard –** It blocks trackers of the sites you access in the Private Mode.
2. **Strict –** This mode blocks all the trackers that Firefox finds including known and third-party trackers.
3. **Custom –** Choose what to block from Trackers, Cookies, Cryptominers, Fingerprinters.

### Check Exceptions for Blocker

Sometimes the sites that you trust and are added in the exceptions can also cause pop-ups which you wouldn’t even know about.

**How to detect when content blocking is on?**

When Firefox is blocking content on a website, a Shield icon will appear in your address bar.

![Block Pop-ups in Firefox 1-3](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Block-Pop-ups-in-Firefox-1-3.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Click on the Shield icon located between the security padlock icon and site information icon. It provides more information about the content Firefox is blocking, such as trackers or third-party tracking cookies.

##  Method 2  – Uninstall Suspicious Add-ons

The Internet is full of applications/browser extensions that modify web browser settings without consent. These potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) and add-ons are categorized as browser hijackers. In most cases, these so-called browser hijackers infiltrate systems without users’ consent – developers proliferate them using intrusive advertising and “bundling” methods.

### How to Disable Suspicious Add-ons

Disabling an extension or theme will turn it off without removing it:

Click the **Menu** button, click on **Add-ons**.

**Shortcut:** If an add-on is on your toolbar, right-click on it and choose Manage Extension to change its settings or Remove Extension to remove it from Firefox.

Click the **Menu** button, click Add-ons.

##  Method 3  – Install Ad Blocker

The ad blocker – a secret weapon against annoying ads. So many ads, so little patience… It’s time to stop the madness.

An ad blocker is a piece of software that can be used to block ads, and they work in two ways. The first way is when an ad blocker blocks the signal from an advertiser’s server, so the ad never shows up on your page or as a pop-up. Another way ad blocker work is by blocking out sections of a website that could be ads.

Thankfully, you can block advertisements using the Mozilla Firefox Web browser with the installation of a few extensions. AdBlock Plus is the best known of these extensions and with a few mouse clicks, you can subscribe to a block filter that blocks virtually all advertisements. Flash Block and No Script are two other extensions that go a step further.

Open [**AdBlock Plus**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/) in Firefox Add-ons store, and click on **Add to Firefox**.

![Adblock Plus Addon](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Adblock-Plus-Addon.jpg)

Then again click on **Add** button. Now the AdBlock Plus add-on will install.

![Adblock Plus Addon 2](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Adblock-Plus-Addon-2.jpg)

Now AdBlock Plus will start its work. It will block the ads on every website. However, you can add exceptions by visiting the configuration page.

Click on the Adblock Plus add-on and then click on the **Settings** icon.

![Adblock Plus Addon 3](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Adblock-Plus-Addon-3.jpg)

Click on the **Whitelisted websites** in the left sidebar, then enter the URL in the text box and click on **ADD WEBSITE** button.

![Adblock Plus Addon 4](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Adblock-Plus-Addon-4.jpg)
