## Some Backup Tools

Backing up is not only necessary for protecting your files in case of a ransomware attack, but there are many other factors like system crash, hard-drive crash, and others when it becomes essential for a backup of your files. 

When it comes to backing up only the important files, then the cloud services like Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox, and others are more than sufficient. Or you can also back them in an external hard disk. These cloud services don’t provide an auto-backup option, but you can manually do that regularly. But things get different for an enterprise-level of backing up.

So for an extensive backup, you can go for the following options:
