## Which is the right ergonomic office chair for you?

If you need to buy it online and cannot try it out ahead of time, think about your preferences. Do you want a chair with fixed or adjustable back support? A chair with fixed support means the back of the chair might not move as you do. Meanwhile, adjustable back support moves as you do, supporting you in a variety of seating positions. Moreover, tension adjustment, lumbar support, and adjustable armrests are other factors you should consider.

## How did we choose these ergonomic office chairs?

When selecting the best ergonomic office chairs, many factors were in play. One of the most important was cost. Since people have a wide range of budget needs, it was vital to show chairs from different cost categories. That way, you can identify the best model that meets your financial requirements. 

Moreover, comfort was another consideration. Did the chair have adjustable height controls to accommodate a wide range of people? After all, having great posture helps to reduce lower back pain and fatigue during a long day. On this front, the adjustable features were also vital. Did the model come with adjustable armrests? Did it have lumbar support? 

Another point of emphasis was on design. Chairs that offered mesh backing and flexibility to align with your sitting positions gained priority. We also examined specialty features like the forward seat tilting, as it allows an even weight distribution, and results in less back and hip pain.

Further, customer reviews played a critical role. When examining insights, comfort, price, ease of set up, durability, and value were all assets. We also looked to see if there were any commonalities in the complaints that might adversely affect the quality of the chair. 

Lastly, what kind of warranty did the manufacturer provide? If you are spending hundreds on a chair, it should have the backing to protect your investment.

## What is an ergonomic office chair?

An ergonomic office chair is a piece of furniture that is designed to work with your body in order to alleviate tension and pain that can build up over time. They often have reinforced shoulder, headrest, and lumbar areas for extra support as well as designs that contour with your body for better comfort and range of motion.

## What is the best ergonomic office chair for lumbar support?

The Sidiz T50 is our pick for the best ergonomic chair for lumbar support. The S curve of the backrest supports and aligns your back while the forward tilt of the entire chair better distributes your weight to take pressure off of your hips and lower back. It also has 5 different reclining positions for when you need to stretch those sore and tense muscles.

## What seat height should I look for if I'm over six feet tall? Or five feet?

Since heights and body postures vary widely, the best way to determine your chair height is to sit on a chair with both feet flat on the ground. Before measuring, make sure your elbows form an open angle between 90 to 100 degrees -- your wrists align with the keyboard. Have someone measure the distance between the floor and your chair seat. Doing so helps you find the seat height you need. 

## How do I adjust an ergonomic office chair?

It depends on the model you selected. Some come with pneumatic controls, while others have a knob. Pressing on the lever allows you to slide the chair up and down until you have a comfortable seating position. The same applies to the knob controls. Although, in these cases, you need to loosen the knob to allow the seat to adjust the height. Once you find the proper position, tighten the knob, and you are good to go.

## Are there alternative ergonomic office chairs worth considering?

There are lots of options out there if you're looking for an ergonomic office chair. However, we only found one alternative we thought was worth the money:
