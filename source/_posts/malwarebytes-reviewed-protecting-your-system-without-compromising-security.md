## User Opinions & Reviews

![Malwarebytes User Reviews](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Malwarebytes-User-Reviews.jpg)

Mixed reviews and varied user opinions have been recorded for this product. Various users have reported the software to be easy to install. Users have praised the Chameleon feature of this software that‚Äôs used to counteract the malware. Users have also found out that the software removes the annoying toolbars and adware. However, along with the positive ratings, the internet is flooded with people disappointed over the use of this software. Many users are frustrated over the fact that this software does not provide a ‚ÄúQuick Scan‚Äù option. This software doesn‚Äôt even have a scan scheduler. This software doesn‚Äôt even inspect the emails. You need to update the malware definitions manually.

![Malwarebytes User Reviews 2](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Malwarebytes-User-Reviews-2.jpg)

Users have phrased the software as ‚ÄúAn average antivirus program that works great when used alongside various other programs.‚Äù For some users, this software has worked miracles and eliminated the potential malware from their computers. Some have reported the software to be too expensive for their good.

On a comparative note, Malwarebytes is far better than most of the old anti-malware softwares on the internet.

## Conclusion: Is Malwarebytes Safe?

 Malwarebytes is considered to be safe to use  and can easily be helpful in case of possible malware detection. However, various fake versions of the software are available all over the Internet that could easily compromise the computer of the user. People are recommended to download the software from their official website. 

However, it has been reported from time-to-time that people couldn‚Äôt rely on this software for their overall purposes. It‚Äôs true that this software works effectively and prevents your computer from being infected.

If you are still unsure or have second thought, I would suggest downloading MalwareFox. One of the most useful anti-malware software, this software can work miracles.

if you want to keep your privacy don‚Äôt use comodo esed and malwarebytes! they use these so called security softwares as the trojan horses in your pc. they can destroy your computer.  
comodo‚Äôs owner abdulhey is turkish. esed turkey belongs to fareed sahenk, a turkish businessman doing everything for turkey‚Äôs dictator. they both work for turkish dictator tayip ‚Äúthe sharlo mustache‚Äù erdogan.  
even firefox and tor browser aren‚Äôt safe. as far as i know there are some turkish spies/rats among the developers. and they leak some critical information about firefox and tor browser to turkey‚Äôs spy chief hakan ‚Äúthe oax‚Äù fidan.  
believe or not these are the facts gals.  
don‚Äôt use any of them until they get rid of the rats among them!  
especially firefox has been acting like a stalker and an abuser for a while!

   My guess is that when it uninstalls, it doesn‚Äôt do a very good job of cleaning out the Windows registry. You might have to run regedit (backup \[export to desktop\] your registry first). Search entire registry to any common terms such as malwarebytes. Be careful to read each entry the search lands on before deleting anything. Good luck, and learn how to use regedit before using it.

I ran both on an infected computer which had a viral browser plugin. Malwarefox kept giving me red flags but did absolutely nothing to stop or prevent it, then I ran Malwarebytes which didn‚Äôt even detect the viral plugin but instead removed local pua‚Äôs. But absolutely nothing to resolve the browser issue, so I ran both software again and same results. Then I simply removed the browser plugin manually and re-ran the tests lo and behold neither software detected anything.  
This was tested on both paid licenses!

Malware bytes is DANGEROUS to your PC. It is also UNreliable. I purchased the licensed version of MalwareBytes several years ago. I‚Äôll explain these SERIOUS PROBLEMS. The licensed versions run on (3) computers at the office. EVERY TIME the software updates to a new version, the update FAILS and must be REMOVED and reinstalled with license key information. This process is beyond the scope of the other office people so the IT person must be the one to do the UN/Install. That takes unnecessary time ‚Äì during which MWB is non functional. However, much worse is a recent development where MWB asks you to install the latest version and then, GET THIS, DEMANDS ‚Ä¶ DEMANDS ‚Ä¶ DEMANDS that you REBOOT NOW or it will in 10 minutes automatically with NO WAY TO DEFEAT THE REBOOT. If your computer happens to be in the middle of a mission critical process that CANNOT BE INTERRUPTED ‚Äì MWB will interrupt it anyhow! THIS ARROGANT FORCE REBOOT MAKES MWB ON PAR WITH MALWARE ITSELF. No competent company would EVER release software that AMBUSHES YOU WITH A FORCED REBOOT! Consider how tremendously dangerous an UNprofessional that is! MWB took out a SERVER at our location! It took over a DAY to bring it back on line. NO SALES WERE MADE FROM IT DURING THAT PERIOD! If you are wise, you will pull this software out of every computer you own and replace it with software that does not do MORE DAMAGE THAN IT PROTECTS FROM!
