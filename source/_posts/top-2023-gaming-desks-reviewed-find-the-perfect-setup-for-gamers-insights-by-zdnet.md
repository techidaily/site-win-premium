## Top 2023 Gaming Desks Reviewed: Find the Perfect Setup for Gamers - Insights by ZDNET

To fully immerse yourself in a game, you need space to set up peripherals like your mouse, keyboard, headset rack, speakers, and maybe multiple monitor stands. If you live stream your gaming sessions to Twitch or YouTube, you may also want room for a microphone, boom stand, and other equipment.

While a gaming room is ideal for hobbyists and pros alike, it's not an option for most people -- especially if you rent or live with family and friends. However, a corner with the right furniture can work just as well if you invest in a high-quality gaming desk. 

Below, you will find my top recommendations for the best gaming desks of 2023\. Whether you want a massive rig or a convenient space saver, I rounded up a variety of options to fit your budget and needs.

**Bestier L-shaped gaming desk f** **eatures:** L-shaped design to fit accessories | Comes with a 47-inch laptop stand | LED lighting strips

The Bestier L-shaped gaming desk is my top choice, and it can be purchased at Walmart. Available in red or black, the Bestier L-shaped gaming desk measures 56.6 inches and is pretty affordable at just under $150.

I have a fondness for L-shaped designs in general, because they offer plenty of space for a keyboard, mouse, and other accessories, without taking up a full wall in a room. This desk also features a writing table you can use to house two or three gaming monitors. 

As a bonus, this desk comes with useful accessories: a 47-inch laptop stand, LED lighting strips, a cup rack, and a headphone stand. The carbon fiber matte black surface is a nice, modern touch. Overall, this is an excellent desk for gaming that also works well as a home office.

Ikea/ZDNET

Pros & Cons 

**Pros** 
* Sturdy
* Multi-functional
* Plenty of space for a PC, printer, and peripherals

**Cons** 
* A pain to assemble
* Only available in black and white
* Plastic feel

More Details 

**Ikea Fredde gaming desk f** **eatures:** Cupholders | Fits a monitor up to 32 inches | High panel side can block glare and sunlight 

The Ikea Fredde is an excellent multi-use desk for both work and gaming. Ikea is known for its range of flat-back furniture, and countless websites show you how to 'hack' the design basics. While the Fredde is undoubtedly basic, it has features that are great for gamers, like off-the-floor shelves for your tower, printer, and speakers. 

**Also: [The best gaming speakers you can buy](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-gaming-speakers/)**

The desk includes a mid-height workstation for your keyboard (complete with cup holders and a cut-out for wires), a second shelf for monitors, and a top shelf for other items. You can use trunking to hold your headset, while side panels keep out obtrusive light. 

I used this specific model for years, and it was a brilliant investment. I chose to leave off the side panels, though, and I believe it improved the design.

As all gamers know, lighting and audio can greatly impact your experience. This gaming desk by Eureka combines LED lighting with a smooth glass finish to take things to the next level. Let's be honest -- it looks cool, too. 

Music-sensing LED effects offer greater customization, too. You can blend your gaming experience and RGB lighting with 27 nodes to choose from. Plus, there's a dimming capability for when you want less visual stimulation. You can access these features through the Smart App control, available for download on iOS and Android devices. 

The L-shaped Eureka desk has a 60-inch length that offers plenty of surface area. You can house many gaming accessories such as monitors, keyboards, mice, and more. A cup holder and headset holder are also included.

More Details 

**Secretlab Magnus Pro standing desk f** **eatures:** Sit and stand capabilities | Metal construction | RGB light system 

The Secretlab Magnus Pro is one of the best gaming desks on the market. Although expensive, the Magnus Pro is a worthwhile purchase if you're willing to invest in a sturdy, cable-friendly, and ergonomic gaming desk. 

The Magnus Pro builds on Secretlab's older Magnus metal desk by implementing sit-to-stand legs, a seamless RGB light system, and exceptional cable management. It has a fully-integrated power supply column (located in a desk leg) with a built-in socket to power all of your gaming devices. 

Constructed of metal, this sturdy desk is quite heavy, but that means it can handle your personalized gaming rig, no matter how complicated. You can also purchase accessories like cable management kits, desk mats, smart lighting, LAN extenders, and headphone hangers to build the desk of your dreams.

## Which is the right gaming desk for you?

When you're buying a gaming desk, you should consider how you'll use it. Will you only use this desk for gaming, or are you working from home, too? You should take measurements to ensure the new desk fits your available space and decide if shelves are a priority or not. 

My decision tree below can help you decide which option may work best for you:

| **Choose this best gaming desk** | **If you want…**                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bestier L-shaped                 | An L-shaped desk with ample room for large monitors and a modern design                    |
| Atlantic Original                | A no-frills gaming desk that works well in small spaces and has a detachable monitor stand |
| Ikea Freddie                     | A sturdy desk with off-the-floor shelves, cup holders, and a cutout for accessory wiring   |
| Eureka                           | A sleek gaming desk complete with LED lights, a glass finish, and an L-shaped design       |
| Secretlab Magnus Pro             | Standing desk capabilities, metal construction, and an RGB light system                    |

## How did we choose these gaming desks?

When researching the best gaming desks, I considered size, durability, and gaming-specific features. I also rated the comfort and functionality of each desk based on keyboard and mouse use. 

Lastly, I took note of extra components like shelves, space for speakers, towers, and peripherals. And, of course, I made sure to choose design options likely to appeal to gamers. 

## Can a glass desk hold a PC?

In short, yes. Most glass desks are manufactured from tempered glass to prevent cracks and scratches. As a result, these desks can support a fair amount of weight. However, the strength of a glass desk depends on the shape and manufacturer, so you should check the manual to see how much weight it can safely support. 

Most glass desks can support the weight of a standard PC, but you may miss useful shelving found on non-glass or glass-hybrid desks if you opt for a complete glass option. It will certainly be stylish but could be more of a chore to keep clean, too.

## What is the difference between a regular desk and a gaming desk?

Beyond how they are marketed, gaming desks are often designed with features gamers find appealing. This can include extra shelves, dedicated space for a tower PC, cable organizers, and pipes for hanging up headsets.

However, a gaming desk can be used for more than just gaming. With proper organization, you can create a multi-functional space for work and entertainment while fitting your gaming consoles and PC rigs.

## Are gaming chairs worth it?

Once you have a gaming desk, is it worth investing in a gaming chair? 

If you're spending a lot of time at a desk -- whether for work or gaming -- my answer is yes.

Sitting in an uncomfortable, rigid chair for long periods can leave you stiff and result in long-term spinal problems. Gaming chairs are designed for comfort and back support -- and they can serve as a stylish addition to your gaming corner, too.

## Are there alternative gaming desks worth considering?

While analyzing the best products on the market, I kept in mind that not everyone has space for a dedicated gaming room. Beyond personal preference and available space, many gamers have different gaming equipment and play styles.

As a result, I've listed a few other options worth considering:
