### Regular Update

No operating system is created perfect. That is why it is important to install updates and patches. You do not have to worry about this as Windows 10 automatically downloads and installs automatic updates. It is important to follow the update instructions if there are any. Additionally, you may want to let your operating system finish its update before doing anything else on the computer. This avoids any incomplete or broken updates which may affect system files such as Browser\_broker.exe.
