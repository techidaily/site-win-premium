## How to Fix Browser\_broker.exe Problems

Avoiding and fixing issues involving Browser\_broker.exe, whether legitimate issues in the operating system or by malware, needs a clean and healthy computer system. Here are a few steps that you can do:

### Disk Cleanup

You can conduct a Disk Cleanup to delete any temporary files in your computer. Simply press the Windows key and the letter ‘**Q**‘ at the same time. Type ‘**cmd**‘ in the search box.![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Type-cmd.png)Right-click on the **Command Prompt** and choose “**Run as administrator**.”![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Run-as-Admin.png)In the **Command Prompt**, type the command **cleanmgr**. Then, press enter.![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cleanmgr.png)Choose the disk that you want to clean in the window that will pop up. Follow the prompt to conduct a Disk Cleanup. Note that the Disk Cleanup may take a few minutes.![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Disk-cleanup.png) 

### System File Checker

After the Disk Cleanup, you can use the **System File Checker** to examine Windows files for errors and restore damaged files. On the Command Prompt, type “**sfc /scannow**“. Then press enter.![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/scannow.png)Just like Disk Cleanup, the System File Checker will take a few minutes.

### General Computer Cleanup

Uninstall any programs that you no longer need. This is especially important if you are using a laptop which comes with a few bloatware. The rule of thumb is if you haven’t used an application within the last 6 months, then it might be a good idea to remove it. Moreover, check what apps are running during startup. Open the Task Manager as you did above. Go to the **Startup** tab. Examine which apps are needed on startup. To disable a program, right-click on it. Then click **Disable** from the drop-down menu.![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Startup-1.png)For more information about maintaining a clean and fast computer, follow the steps in [this article](https://www.windowschimp.com/speedup-windows-10/).

### Regular Update

No operating system is created perfect. That is why it is important to install updates and patches. You do not have to worry about this as Windows 10 automatically downloads and installs automatic updates. It is important to follow the update instructions if there are any. Additionally, you may want to let your operating system finish its update before doing anything else on the computer. This avoids any incomplete or broken updates which may affect system files such as Browser\_broker.exe.
